## *Domain Modeling*

**The domain model is a representation of meaningful real-world concepts pertinent to the domain that need to be modeled in software. The concepts include the data involved in the business and rules the business uses in relation to that data. A domain model leverages natural language of the domain.**

> *Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.*

> *A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders.*

## HTML `Table`

> **The `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.**

Each table row is defined with a `<tr>` tag. Each table header is defined with a `<th>` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a `<td>` tag.

By default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in `<td>` elements are regular and left-aligned.

**When you have a spaces between row and column we use in `<style>` tag the `border-collapse: collapse;` command to remove break.**

## “Functions, Methods, and Objects

`A **function** in **JavaScript** is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.`

`JavaScript **Methods** are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Property.`

`An **Object** is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.`
