## Unordered HTML List

>An unordered list starts with the **ul** tag. Each list item starts with the **li** tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

# CSS

## CSS Boxes

*In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.*

**The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:**

**Explanation of the different parts:**

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent


>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

# JavaScript

**If you need somthing, You will make the condition in correct way.**

**Thats mean the condition is important to make sometheing, but when i need to test something over than 100 tested?**

*You need to using loops such as* 

* While loop type or
* for loop or
* Do While loop.

Ok .. *Have One type of condition ?* **No Sure, We have switch statment..**

>Syntax:

switch (variable value)

{

    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
    default:
        break;
}

**We Have Main things in switch**
* using break to stop work
* case to select which condition is worked
* default using when nocase is work
