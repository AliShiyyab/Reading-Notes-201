# JavaScript Function

>**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

>**A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**


> *Syntax*

>```function myFunction() { boody }```

## Why Function?

**We are using function to use some code when i need not when the web is works.**

## **Function Invocation**
The code inside the function will execute when "something" *invokes* (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)

## Function Return
*When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.*

**If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.**

>Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
